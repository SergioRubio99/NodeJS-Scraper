# Introduction

Welcome to this project! The software you are about to see is a web scraper for the popular website https://news.ycombinator.com/. 

It scrapes each article and extracts its title, link, age, creator, number of comments, and points earned by that article. The data is stored in a JSON file with an array containing each article inside an object.

Here's an example of what the JSON file will look like:

```{
"nycombinator": [
{
"title": "Show HN: Plus â€“ Self Updating Screenshots",
"url": "https://www.plusdocs.com/",
"points": 74,
"user": "alixaxel",
"age": "1 hour",
"comments": 34
},
{...},
{...}
]
}
```
