# Introduction

Welcome to this project! The software you are about to see is a web scraper for the popular website https://news.ycombinator.com/. 

It scrapes each article and extracts its title, link, age, creator, number of comments, and points earned by that article. The data is stored in a JSON file with an array containing each article inside an object.

Here's an example of what the JSON file will look like:

```{[
{
"title": "Show HN: Plus â€“ Self Updating Screenshots",
"url": "https://www.plusdocs.com/",
"points": 74,
"user": "alixaxel",
"age": "1 hour",
"comments": 34
},
{...},
{...}
]
```

### How to set the app up with Docker:

Use the following command in the project folder to build the image:
 - `docker image build -t nodescraper .`
 <br>
 
Use the following command to run the image on the 3000 port:
<br>
- ` docker container run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 --name node nodescraper `


Inside the container, just run `npm run start` to lift the server, or `npm run test` to run the tests.
